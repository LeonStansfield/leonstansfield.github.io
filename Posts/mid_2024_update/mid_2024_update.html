                        It's been almost a year since I last posted here. This is surprising because I have definitely
                        been
                        busy… but ultimately it's for a few reasons. The first is that I made the portfolio website
                        because I was applying for placement positions and internships. After many applications,
                        aptitude tests and interviews, I landed an industrial placement! This is of course good news,
                        but I had no reason to keep updating it so often.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second is that I am generally busy with university, both academically and socially. I have
                        just finished the second year of my degree, and the largest chunk of my time since September has
                        been going into that. While I am incredibly proud of the work I have produced for my course, not
                        much of it aligns with the images or themes I want to project here (engine, graphics and game
                        programming) so I haven't put it here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With that being said, I have worked on some cool little projects, if a little less than I would
                        have hoped. Which I will now tell you about.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Concert Visuals</h2>
                    <p>
                        Making software for managing and displaying real-time dynamic visuals for live music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Back in November, I went to a concert for a local band called <a
                            href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3pMZZzAKwSIftJmwtEx56W">SCALER</a>, who are really
                        cool and
                        importantly have some really cool visuals. After their concert, I sat on the bus home and
                        wondered if I could make something like that. That idea sat with me for a solid 9 hours (the
                        next morning) when I opened up Godot and got to work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted my visuals to be unique in a few ways. I wanted them to be rendered in real-time, not
                        pre-rendered, so they could be dynamically controlled with live music or a DJ set, something a
                        bit more spontaneous. I wanted the user to have control over the show. I wanted a visual
                        manager, a hub where you could swap between scenes at run time, tweak the properties of
                        individual visuals inside a scene and trigger auto actions, such as animations, bursts of light
                        or GDScript functions. To tie it together I wanted it to automatically sync to the beat of a
                        song. Imagine setting a specific effect, like a flash of light, to happen every 4 beats or a
                        visual transformation to occur on every beat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am not sure if any of that makes sense, but alas my vision was strong, and I got to work. The
                        structure of the system I built is as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We have the visual manager. This is a singleton that keeps track of all the visual elements
                            in the current scene.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We have the visual container, which is the parent node of all visuals in the scene. Upon
                            loading a scene, this will create the list of visuals and pass this to the visual manager.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We have the individual visuals themselves. The visuals are the nodes that contain the actual
                            meshes, lights, panels, and whatever the visual is. Each visual has a script with a function
                            call_action(action_index). When called, this function will call the action of the relevant
                            index.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On the UI side, we have the visual manager UI, which is the separate window which contains
                            the UI for managing the visuals. Using this UI, we can set the BPM on the auto action
                            manager, load new scenes and sync the BPM. On loading a new scene, it will instantiate a
                            mini ‘visual UI’ component component for each visual on the scene.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Each visual UI has some controls for each visual element, allowing you to assign actions and
                            sync them to the music’s beat.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finally, the auto action manager keeps time with the music, triggering the assigned auto
                            actions at the correct time with the set BPM.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This system lets you create dynamic, real-time visuals for music performances and would be
                        perfect for DJ sets or other audio-visual experiences.
                    </p>

                        class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block">
                    <p>
                        So that’s an outline of the system itself, but the cool thing about this system is it can be
                        paired with any aesthetic of visuals conceivable. I put a lot of effort into creating some
                        visuals including shader effects, 3D models and animations to demonstrate its capabilities. The
                        aesthetic I was going for would fit a techno or electro rave, with psychedelic colourful and
                        fast visuals.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Imagine that being projected on a massive screen with the loudest thumping techno in some
                        basement club… I think it would be awesome. The project has been left on standby for now, as it
                        is mostly complete and I don’t currently have any use cases, although am hoping to get some use
                        out of it for some friends bands who have expressed interest in its use for their live shows.

                    <h2>Sparrow Hawk Engine</h2>
                    <p>
                        Making a node-based game engine that uses Blender as a level editor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I cannot remember where, or if this is even true, but I had heard that Rockstar’s rage engine
                        doesn’t actually have an editor, just a complex pipeline of plugins that take levels created in
                        software like Maya or something, and imports them into the engine, which is just a visual studio
                        project or something. This got the old gears turning in my head. If I wanted to create game
                        engines, this would be a great way to approach level design. Why reinvent the wheel, when I
                        could just use Blender to actually design levels, write a script to export them into a file type
                        my engine could read, and then when I run the engine, it reads said file and loads the level I
                        created. To add to this, I wanted to improve my engine fundamentally from my previous attempt,
                        Merlin. In Merlin, I simply had a vector to keep track of all the objects in my scene. This is a
                        fine, simple approach, but it can be beneficial to have objects have a relation to one another.
                        To combat this, I wanted my new engine to have a node tree approach, so objects can be children,
                        or parents of other objects, and children will inherit their parent’s properties such as
                        position or rotation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So once again, I got to work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To start off with, I designed the core of the engine. Sparrow Hawk Engine works by assigning
                        each object a list containing references to its children. When the engine updates the scene, it
                        starts at the “root” object (think of it as the head of the family tree) and iterates through
                        all its children, calling their update functions. This process continues down the hierarchy,
                        ensuring every object gets updated in the correct order.
                    </p>
                    <img src="Resources\screenshot-2024-05-17-101115.webp"
                        alt="A diagram showing the way the node tree is explored depth first"
                        class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block">
                    <p>
                        Next up we needed children to inherit their parent’s properties. To do this, the engine
                        differentiates between its global position (relative to the entire world) and local position
                        (relative to their parent), for example. When a parent object moves, we want its children to
                        move with it. Since the object is drawn based on its global position, I achieve this by updating
                        the global positions based on the local positions and their parent’s position in each frame.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final task was the blender integration. I needed a way to export 3D models and scene
                        information from Blender into a format my engine could understand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To achieve this, I wrote a Python script for Blender. This script performs two key tasks:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Exporting Meshes:</strong> It iterates through all the objects in your Blender scene
                            and checks if they are meshes (3D models). If they are, the script exports each mesh as a
                            separate GLB file.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Creating a Scene Description File:</strong> In addition to the models, the engine
                            needs to know how these objects are positioned and arranged in the scene. The script tackles
                            this by creating a text file named “scene.txt”. This file stores information for each
                            object, including the name, location, rotation, scale and relationships between parents and
                            children.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block">
                    <p>
                        Here is a look at what a scene description file looks like:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the engine, I created a scene manager class that would parse the data exported from Blender
                        and create the corresponding objects within the game world. This integration worked reasonably
                        well, allowing me to import and position objects created in Blender. One persistent challenge
                        involved accurately inheriting the rotation of objects between parent and child nodes. This
                        issue remains unresolved as Ultimately, with winter break ending and other commitments taking
                        priority, I had to temporarily step away from the project.

                        Despite this, the Sparrow Hawk engine was a great learning experience and definitely further
                        strengthened my understanding of game engines and C++. I am incredibly proud of the project and
                        may well pick it up again in the future.

                    <h2>Graphing the Internet</h2>
                    <p>
                        So I saw a <a href="https://youtu.be/JheGL6uSF-4?si=jA4qVoZz-kcNLfG-">cool video</a> of someone
                        who created a cool 2D visualization of Wikipedia, with pages
                        grouped based on their relevance to one another. I had an idea; wouldn’t it be cool to explore
                        the internet in a 3D graph, the same way you explore the galaxy maps in games like No Man Sky or
                        Elite Dangerous?
                    </p>
                    <img src="Resources\nms1dot3galaxymap.webp" alt="A screenshot of the galaxy map in No Man's Sky"
                        class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block">
                    <p>
                        So I tried to create a program to do just that. I decided to use Rust, for no reason other than
                        it seems trendy and up my street. I created a program that would begin by crawling websites,
                        construct a graph of the websites and then render them in 3D.
                    </p>
                    <img src="Resources\screenshot-from-2024-05-17-10-43-58.webp"
                        alt="A screenshot of a website graphed out in 3D" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block">
                    <p>
                        The program starts by taking a URL, scraping its HTML content, and extracting all the links on
                        that page. It then recursively scrapes those linked pages, building a massive web of
                        connections. As links are discovered, the program creates a graph data structure. Each webpage
                        becomes a node, and the links between them are represented as edges connecting these nodes. With
                        the graph created, the challenge became visualizing it. I used Macroquad, a Rust library similar
                        to Raylib, to draw the nodes and edges as spheres and lines between them.

                        While this approach creates a cool way to visualize websites, it has a couple limitations, such
                        as its scalability. This method works well for smaller websites. However, large sites with
                        thousands of pages would quickly become overwhelming visual messes. I also ran into issues with
                        node positioning. Initially, I assigned random positions to nodes, which wasn’t ideal. I aimed
                        to implement a system like <a href="https://logseq.com/">Logseq</a> (a note-taking app), where
                        node positions are determined by
                        their connections to other nodes.

                        Unfortunately, I never did think of a solution to this problem before exam season kicked off and
                        I had to focus on essays and group projects and I ended up shelving the project.

                    <h2>Osprey Engine</h2>
                    <p>
                        An ECS-based game engine built in Rust
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So this final project I will talk about very much sprung from the grave of the previous web
                        graphing project. I wanted to create a new game engine – this time in Rust, and structured
                        around an entity component system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Osprey engine is built in Rust using Macroquad. The engine is implemented using a vector of
                        Entity objects and several hashmaps that map entity IDs to their respective components, such as
                        position, rect, colour and layer. The engine has many systems implemented. For example, a
                        “render system” iterates through entities and their components, drawing them on the screen based
                        on their position, size, and texture information. Another system handles camera movement,
                        updating the camera’s position based on user input.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The engine is very much still is still under active development. I have even ventured into a 3D
                        version, that has a basic integration of the rapier 3D physics engine to add collisions. I
                        really like this engine structure, the ease of implementing the third dimension and rapier 3D’s
                        physics shows how easy it is to expand the engine and add new components and systems for added
                        functionality.

                    <p>
                        I am really excited about this engine, its modularity and ease of expansion are very compelling
                        and I look forward to working on it more. With any luck, I will probably make another post about
                        it.

                        So that’s a little look at what I have been working on. It’s funny – I have a collection of
                        foundational game engines and frameworks, but no finished games to show for it. Part of the
                        reason is that none of them are quite there yet, but another part is that I haven’t actually
                        tried making a game within them. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. It doesn’t help that whenever
                        I feel inspired to make games, I may try to use some lower-level framework that I have written,
                        but I end up crawling back to the comforts and luxuries of Godot.

                    <p>
                        However, after playing Animal Well recently, I am feeling quite inspired. Games that are
                        astonishing in quality, yet grounded in technical achievability, are incredibly inspiring. If
                        only I could imagine worlds as complex, stories as intricate, and levels as mind-boggling as the
                        one Billy Basso imagined. The software itself doesn’t seem like the unachievable bit anymore.

                        Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this little look into my mind and at a few projects I have been
                        working on in the last several months!
