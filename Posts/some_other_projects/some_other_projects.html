                    <h3>Racoon</h3>
                    <p>A racoon character I modelled, textured, rigged and animated for my YouTube videos! He continues
                        to be the face of my videos today!</p>

                    <h3>Well warrior</h3>
                    <p>A game I made for the brackeys 2023.1 game jam! The game features fast paced top down shooter
                        gameplay, set in a labyrinth of procedural rooms. You play as a warrior in search for the well
                        of peace. Upon death you respawn, keeping all currency, which you can use at a shop as well as
                        your purchased upgrades. Check it out <a

                    <h3>Combat prototype</h3>
                    <p>A small <a href="https://x.com/Leonstansfield0/status/1563645467803746305">combat prototype</a>
                        that I worked on for a few weeks, designed to be similar to Hyper Light
                        Drifter in 3D. The project was eventually abandoned as it was when I was starting university,
                        but it was good fun to work on!</p>

                    <h3>Grounded</h3>
                    <p>A game built for the bullet hell jam 2022, coming in at a hot 22 overall (out of 296). The game
                        features fast paced and satisfying bullet hell gameplay with a vibrant art style. It is
                        available on the web but is best played on a desktop. Play it <a
