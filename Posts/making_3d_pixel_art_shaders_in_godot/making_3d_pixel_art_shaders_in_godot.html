                    <p>I love pixel art… I love looking at pixel art, I love making pixel art. Pixel art is great. But
                        do you know what would be even greater? 3D pixel art. We have seen the effect in games like A
                        Short Hike (which by the way, is the game that got me into development, after loving the game
                        and watching Adam's postmortem I decided to give the ol’ Unity a try), but firstly, how is this
                        done in Godot, and how can we take some of the core concepts of what makes pixel art pixel art
                        and apply them as well?</p>
                    <h2>Pixelation</h2>
                    <p>Ok so first up is the most obvious… pixelation. Luckily Godot has a really easy-to-use built-in
                        option for this. First up, head to project settings, and then under the display and then window
                        settings you will notice 2 sets of boxes, 1 for the width and height that the engine will render
                        and the other called ‘test width/height’ which will be the size of our window. We want to change
                        the test resolution to our default window resolution of 1024*600 and then set our width and
                        height as our pixel art resolution. In my case that’s 512*288, but it’s up to you, 256*144 is
                        another great size for chunkier pixels. We also need to head down to the stretch options and set
                        the mode to viewport and aspect to keep to prevent our pixels being stretched when the window is
                        moved around.</p>
                    <p>Awesome! So now when we run our scene we get some nice chunky pixels!</p>

                    <h2>Palette Limitation</h2>
                    <p>What… You're saying that pixel art is more than just downresing a 3D render!!! Are you
                        gatekeeping art! Disgraceful… but no problem, to many, pixel art is more than just chunky pixels
                        on a screen. Colour is just as important. The vast majority of pixel art is done using a limited
                        colour palette, so we too will need to achieve that too. To start off I will change all my
                        materials to use Godot's built-in toon shader. This will mean objects will mostly only have two
                        sets of colours, their lit colours and their shaded colours which will help when we are limiting
                        the colours drawn to the screen. To do this just go to the properties of each material and under
                        diffuse and specular mode swap them for toon, then set the roughness to 0 and metallic to 0.5. I
                        have no idea how these shaders work but my friend Nekoto has a great tutorial on their own toon
                        shader in the style of Breath of the Wild. As well as this I will let you know I am using an
                        orthogonal camera projection.</p>
                    <p>This means things further away from the camera will not appear further away and is quite a common
                        way for pixel art to be drawn, also I just think it looks nice with this top down projection.
                        Ok, so now that's done we can work on our palette limiting shader. To be clear, I didn’t make
                        this either, it's taken straight from TheBuffEd’s video (linked in the description), but
                        essentially, we have a list of colours, with each number in the vector 4 representing the RGBA
                        values but on a scale of 0-1 instead of 0-256. In the fragment function for each pixel we store
                        the current colour of the pixel, then loop through all the colours in our list to find the
                        colour with the minimum difference in colour, we then set the pixel to that colour. I highly
                        recommend watching their video, it's super quick and they explain it better than I can.</p>

                        alt="A screenshot of a scene rendered in its limited palletes">
                    <p>I am using the Apollo palette I found on Lospec, so I had to divide the RGBA values by 256 and
                        add them to this list, which took a good while, but honestly I’d rather spend 1 hour doing
                        something than 6 failing to automate it.</p>
                    <p>So now we can just add this shader to a sprite 2D that covers the whole viewport, it doesn’t
                        matter what the sprite actually is, and make sure it's at the top of our node tree. Overall this
                        is a really nice effect. It's important to note that changing anything about the environment
                        lights can change the look of the game significantly. I recommend having a single directional
                        light for shadows and setting the ambient light to have 0 sky contributions and a plain white
                        ambient colour.</p>

                    <h2>Clouds</h2>
                    <p>I really like how you can only see the grass around the edges of things, it looks very pixel
                        arty. But I think adding some shadows of some clouds where you can properly see the grass would
                        be nice. Once again, after trying a bit to do it myself, I ended up finding a shader user
                        mightofmerchants made a couple years ago and thankfully published on Reddit. The shader
                        essentially takes a noise texture, turns it into 2 noise textures, with the second one being
                        time shifted, and then mixes them, with a threshold value deciding the cutoff value of the
                        cloud. It then turns this into a texture which can cast a shadow.</p>
                    <p>I set the Geometry cast shadow mode to ‘shadow only’ since my game will be top down so I do not
                        need to render the clouds themselves.</p>
                    <p>And that's it! Now we have a beautiful scene with some very nice 3D generated pixel art! It's not
                        quite ‘hand drawn’ quality (I don’t think there's a lot that can be done about jaggies in 3D).
                        Other improvements could include some toon shaded edges, but that's up to personal preference
                        and I do think it looks really nice and the process has taught me even more about shaders… even
                        though I still haven’t actually made any yet. I guess that just shows how great the Godot
                        community is that I haven’t had to make any shaders yet. If you enjoyed this video please
                        subscribe, I have more technical videos coming, but just wanted to make something about what I
                        had been working the past week or so. Thanks for watching!</p>
