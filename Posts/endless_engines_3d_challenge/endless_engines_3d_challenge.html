                    <p>This project was inspired by the beautiful hand drawn films by Studio Ghibli. I wanted to capture
                        the feeling when your train escapes the city and you see oceans of green flying by at 120 miles
                        per hour.</p>

                        alt="A frame from Studio Ghiblis howls moving castle.">
                    <p>I started by creating a ‘sketch’ render, a render which uses a bunch of crappy pre-made assets
                        just so I can get my idea down on the page. As you can see, originally I planned on focusing on
                        having many cherry blossom trees, whizzing past the camera. This idea fell through later on as I
                        felt it didn’t fit my own experiences.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" src="Resources\sketch-render.webp"
                        alt="The sketch render">
                    <p>Once the sketch was done, I jumped into creating some procedural material bases to capture the
                        hand-painted aesthetic of Ghibli films. This consisted of a bunch of different Voronoi and noise
                        textures combined together to give the impression of a material made from splodges and brushes
                        of paint, with little imperfections such as purple splashes, where watercolours may have been
                        spilled and soaked into the material. The result is something I am very pleased with and the
                        technique is used in more than half of the materials in the scene.</p>
                    <p>I opted to use the toon BSDF with cycles as I thought the two-tone shaded look of the toon shader
                        fitted the aesthetic, but still wanted to take advantage of nice soft shadows and realistic
                        global illumination, as well as Blender’s built-in sky materials.</p>

                        alt="My painting material in blender">
                    <p>The train itself was the next problem to tackle, so I got modeling. I ended up learning a bunch
                        of new things and using tools I haven't used before for the train, such as the boolean cut,
                        quick smoke and gas simulations as well as learning new things about topology to model more with
                        less and more usable geometry.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" src="Resources\environment.webp"
                        alt="A render of the environment">
                    <p>By this point, the scene was feeling fairly complete, but still needed a lot of polish to get it
                        off the ground. I started by replacing the old environment with something a little more vibrant,
                        as well as raising the color saturation away from the more pastel palette I was using before, to
                        better match my reference Ghibli screenshots. As well as this, I felt the environment had too
                        much negative space and didn’t have much to say, so I added some more mountains in the
                        background to add some depth to the world, as well as a small house, similar to the one Howl
                        steps out of in Howl’s Moving Castle, in hopes for the viewer to think more about who may be
                        living in the world. Additionally, I generated a fluffy hand-painted cloud in Stable Diffusion
                        to help fill out the background. All these changes made a massive difference to the feel of the
                        scene and left me feeling pleased with what I had made.</p>

                    <p>And there you have it! My aim was to capture the tranquility and excitement of traveling by train
                        and speeding through the countryside as well as some of the nostalgia for watching some of the
                        classic animated films as a child, and, at least for myself, I have done that! I have learned so
                        much about 3D during the challenge, especially in creating procedural materials as well as
                        modeling and topology. It would be an absolute pleasure to be featured in the compilation video!

                    <p>This is my first attempt at creating a more portfolio-style post, showing off my workflow and
                        result. My writing skills in this area are honestly not the best but hopefully will get better.
