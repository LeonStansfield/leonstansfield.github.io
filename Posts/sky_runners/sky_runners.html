                    <!-- Post Content -->
                    <p>Have you ever had an image of a game sit in your head so strong you just had to make
                        it? Well I did, and that image could be described as ‘what if the sky islands from tears of the
                        kingdom were a speed running movement game’. In this blog post, I’ll take you on a journey from
                        the initial idea to the creation of a playable demo for my speed running game Sky Runner. Let’s
                        dive in and explore the steps I took to bring my vision to life.</p>
                    <p>Here is a <a href="https://leon-stansfield.itch.io/sky-runner">link</a> to the demo so you can
                        give it a try yourself!</p>

                    <h2>Conceptualisation</h2>
                    <p>For most of my game ideas, I start with what feels like a screenshot in my brain and expand on
                        what that could become. It is the same for this game. I had a distinct image of a first person
                        speed running/platforming game similar to neon white set in the lush sky islands of tears of the
                        kingdom. I wrote in a notebook a bunch of ideas of where I could take the game. This included
                        listing as mechanics, level sketches, and some terrible concept art sketches. I wanted the game
                        to very much focus on fast paced movement in 3D environments, falling, jumping and running
                        through the sky making split second decisions. As well as this, I wrote down what limitations I
                        wanted to stick to to prevent scope creep. For example, as much as I would love to create
                        something like breath of the wild 3, I decided I was going to stick to very linear level design
                        with level by level progression to ensure I wont be working on the project for another decade.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Designing some mechanics</h2>
                    <p>The first thing I approached was a character controller. I wanted to prototype some ways that a
                        player can move through a 3D environment that would be fun.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately from my notes, I settled on the dash which would launch the player horizontally, a
                        grapple mechanic, letting the player zip to any surface in range, a bounce pad to help the
                        player gain altitude and a gravity dive, to help the player fly downwards. Prototyping is
                        incredibly fun and I created some really fun ways to play very quickly. Generally speaking, you
                        know a mechanic is good fun when playing around with it is distracting you from working on the
                        rest of a project, so that was a positive from the get go.</p>
                    <p>While continuing to work I added some game juice and implementing important UI to signal
                        important information to the player. This included these speed lines to help emphasise the
                        players speed and a modified version of the speed lines for the dash effect. I also added some
                        UI icons to indicate weather the dash and grapple were currently usable, as well as some
                        particles for when the states are changing to make it stand out to the player.</p>
                    <p>Sound design is very important for game design, so I invested time in creating and adding some
                        satisfying sound effects I made by mixing and modifying audio samples and synthesized sounds.
                        Finally to help improve the vibe of a speed running game, I composed some 170BPM jungle music to
                        keep the player hyped up. Music composition is something I am not a massive fan of as it is not
                        really my field, but the fast drum beats I created work well in the game and don’t sound
                        terrible I think.</p>
                    <p>Its important to note that a lot of this polish was done in parallel with designing the levels
                        and rest of the game, but I don’t think it makes sense to tell it chronologically as that would
                        be a bit of a mess to read.</p>

                    <h2>Level design and progression</h2>
                    <p>When designing the 13 short levels in the game, I knew it was important to introduce each
                        mechanic individually and teach the player how to use each mechanic through play. To do this I
                        followed a 3 step approach:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Introduce the mechanic in a simple, safe and controlled environment.</li>
                        <li>Show the mechanic in a different environment.</li>
                        <li>Show the environment in a more complex environment, mixing it with other mechanics to show
                            what can be done.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can see this approach in every mechanic I introduce. For example, with the grapple, it is
                        given a very basic use case, followed by a different case to show the player other ways it can
                        be used. I then demonstrate the mechanic chained together followed by a final dash. Many players
                        will fail at that initially but as they retry, they will learn the mechanic further, preparing
                        them for more difficult challenges in the game.</p>
                    <p>As well as this, I wanted to make sure that the game had a variety of fun levels mixing all
                        mechanics once they had been learned. To do this, I took a tip from mark brown and created a
                        table with all mechanics, ensuring there were combinations of all of them. I then got to mess
                        about throwing many ideas at the wall to see what sticks, some did, some didn’t. This helped me
                        create a large amount of levels that were fun to play, about half the levels I created were
                        scrapped which is always a pain sometimes after hours tying to make work, but sometimes, ideas
                        just weren’t fun to start with and its better to focus the energy on something that works well.
                    </p>
                    <p>Another incredibly important part of level design was playtesting. It helped immensely to sit and
                        watch friends play through the game to see if they were able to figure out mechanics by
                        themselves and read levels to understand where they are required to go. This lead to tens, if
                        not hundreds of micro adjustments in level design, the way tutorials are laid out, UI changes
                        and of course bug fixes to ensure the game is well designed.</p>

                    <h2>Preparing to publish</h2>
                    <p>The Final phase before publishing the demo mostly consisted of creating and polishing UI as well
                        as continuing to adjust levels after playtest sessions (of which I had 3, each with different
                        friends to ensure none had experienced the game before hand) I created the main menu, options
                        menu, level selection menu, pause menu and continued to refine the gameplay UI and tutorial UI
                        and made the UI theme to display on all UI elements. Yeah games just have a bunch of UI and none
                        of it is that fun to be program. Some challenges I ran into were around UI management.</p>
                    <p>Due to poor decisions towards the start of the project I had several very messy and hard to read
                        scripts with hardcoded events controlling all the UI at once. This became unusable if I wanted
                        to change anything later on, so I had to spend a week refactoring much of the UI management code
                        to be more readable, reusable and modular. This was tedious but very worth it especially when
                        coming to write the main menu screens. Even after this UI management is something I would like
                        to get better at in future projects.</p>
                    <p>As well as this, I prepared this post, the itch page and a trailer for my YouTube as well as
                        places to receive further feedback on the game (for both bugs and game design feedback).</p>
                    <p>In this post, I have rundown the process of bringing sky runners to life, from conceptualisation,
                        to my level design process to polishing and release. The entire process has been full of
                        learning further about game design and managing complex projects using the Godot engine. I
                        eagerly anticipate sharing Sky Runner with the gaming community, hoping to gather valuable
                        feedback to further enhance the game.</p>
